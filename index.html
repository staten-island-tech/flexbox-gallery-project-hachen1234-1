            <p>This men is a menace to society this is a sword game not gun game. When you get him to phase 2 he will
                say"How my blood boils! Face me, Sekiro!" and then procced to whip out a gun and a spear. The spear have
                the AOE of 1/6 of the map and if you cannot dodge it that is 3/4 of your hp gone. After hitting you with
                the spear your posture level will already be red and just when you think his attack spree is done he
                will pull out the gun and start to shoot you and when you die to it he will say hEsitATioN iS deFEat

                This is one of the weakest boss in the game. As long as you can hook away you can beat him no problem

                This will be a pretty hard boss but there is a way for it to fall down a cliff and just due.
